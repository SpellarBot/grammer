Get your Yammer notifications though Growl.

Grammer checks for Yammer notifications for you and turns them into Growl notifications.

## Installation

Grammer is written in Clojure and uses the [cake build tool](http://github.com/ninjudd/cake).
To build a standalone executable:

    git clone git://github.com/ninjudd/grammer.git
    cd grammer
    cake bin

Then you can start grammer with:

    ./grammer

Or just download the latest executable from http://cloud.github.com/downloads/ninjudd/grammer/grammer.
